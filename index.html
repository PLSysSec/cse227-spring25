    **CSE 227: Graduate Computer Security**
         [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This course focuses on computer security, exploring a range of topics – from
systems security, to web security, edge security, and privacy – to illustrate
some of the modern research challenges in the area and the standards for
advancement. It is not designed to be a tutorial course, but rather to give
students the context to understand current security research and evaluate their
interest in the field. The course will examine both the defensive and offensive
side of the field. At the conclusion of the course, the students will have the
foundation to conduct research in computer security and to apply the latest
security research to a particular area of practice.

Evaluation
==============================================================

Since the primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
evaluation for this course is simple: (1) class participation and (2)
research project.

Participation (35%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You are expected to read the assigned paper(s) before each meeting. In class we
will discuss the interesting parts of the paper(s). You are expected to do any
background reading on your own and come prepared with questions and an
evaluation of the paper.

Research project (65%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will work on projects in groups of 3-5.  The goal of the project is to
conduct original research in security. You are encouraged to come up with your
own project idea, but we have a few ideas that are well-scoped for a quarter
project.

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to turn in a short research paper
(6-10 pages) and give a 7-10 minute talk. We will have periodic status updates
to help you stay on track.

Comprehensive exam (25%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a MS student taking the comprehensive exam: your project will be
worth 40% (not 65%) and the exam will be worth 25%.

Project ideas
==============================================================

Take a look at [Stefan's list of project
ideas](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/fa21/cse227-a/projects.html). Here is a
list of new projects:

- Sandbox a serious third-party C library in a popular C++ program using RLBox.
- Extend Wasm with provably-safe inline assembly.
- Verify the SFI safety of binaries compiled with wasm2c (via Clang).
- Find bugs by combining source-level static checking (e.g., CodeQL) with low-level symbolic execution (a la Sys).
- Statically (or symbolically) check the IPC layerof Firefox (or Chrome).
- Design and implement an RLBox like system for Rust.
- Extend Rust's bindgen to sandbox C code in Rust projects.
- Extend Node.js' Node-API to sandbox C code for Node.
- Sandbox CPython code.
- Analyze the implications of undefined behavior in sandboxing systems.
- Add hardware backed (e.g., ARM MTE or CHERI) to Memory Safe Wasm (MSWasm) compiler.
- Sandbox (e.g., using containers) npm install scripts.
- Implement a transparency system for (detecting supply chain attacks on) npm.
- Implement a language-level module sandboxing system for Node.js.
- Analyze the top n Node.js module to understand if a capability security model is practical.
- Analyze (attack) the pre-processing stage (e.g., image decoding library) of typical neural network pipelines.
- Verify/check analysis passes (e.g., effects, alias) in JITs.
- Verify peep hole optimizations in the Firefox JIT.
- Verify the security of the V8 Sandbox.
- Port the V8 Sandbox to Firefox' SpiderMonkey.
- Find bugs in or verify uBPF's code generation.
